## To do

08/12
- Display number of total cases (additional feature)

09/12

- Add summaryu to current data page

#### NOTES
- Assumed population is constant from when app booted, valid if not run for too long
- Assuming that each dataset has the same dates for each time series, all dates are found from one
- Countries remain constant from when booted
- Could improve by adding requirement checks and check stuff is available 
- Data is availble from 3 days ago on the website (taken to be safe selected in the scroller)
- Could add a condition to check if new data is available first
- Could improve efficieny of get.df2 by not fetch df twice
- On Data map whole dataset of that type download for the world, NOT TIME DISPLAYED
